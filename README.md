# CSIDH

Pure Rust implementation of of the CSIDH cryptographic algorithm for secret key exchange. Provides a (not yet) constant-time, no_std-friendly implementation.

The current implementation is far from being as fast as the state of the art implementations. The objective is to do an implementation similar to the one in "Lions and Elligators".
