# CSIDH

Pure Rust implementation of the CSIDH cryptographic algorithm for secret key exchange.
Provides a no_std-friendly implementation. Not constant-time yet.

The current implementation is far from being as fast as the state of the art implementations.
The objective is to do an implementation similar to the one in "Lions and Elligators".
